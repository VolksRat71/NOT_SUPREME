**The application is designed with the user in mind**, with snappy transitions, animation, and constant feedback, you can be sure that the user will enjoy every transaction on our platform.

As for you, you will be given _extra_ functionalities, where you can see all the user information all in one place, as well as have easy control over what permissions the users may have.

**Curious about overall financial performance?** So were we. That is why we adopted the Stripe platform where you can overview your applications current/projected sales on an easy-to-understand visualization tool.

**Security is important**. So is usability. We understand that. That is why we encrypt user passwords on our servers and use browser cookies to store a unique token so the user can be certain that they have secure logins from trusted devices.

Be assured that your application is always functioning properly with _automatic testing_. Your application is consistently checking itself for expected values and outputs while looking at each component on a structural level using the industries best testing frameworks.</p>

If you would like to explore our source code, please direct yourself to our [GitHub](https://github.com/volksrat71). Checkout the [deployed application](notsupreme.store) to see it in action.
